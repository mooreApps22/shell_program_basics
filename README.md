# __SHELL PROGRAM BASICS__

[GGR](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/grr/SystemsProgrammingBook/Book/Chapter5-WritingYourOwnShell.pdf)

## **A shell program is a app that allows interacting with the Operating System**
### **Parts of a Shell Program**

Note: All syntax is in bash!

1. Motivation
* It is recommended that you make your own shell form scratch. This will improve your understanding of how the shell interprets applications and interacts with the Operating System
  * It also looks good in a portfolio ðŸ™‚
2. The Parser
  * Interprets the command line and puts it into ```typedef struct s_cmd_tab```
  * ```t_cmd_tab``` stores the commands that will be executed
3. The Executor
  * Takes ```t_cmd_tab``` generated by the parser and creates a process for each command
    * if necessary it creates pipes ```|``` to read/write between each process
  * If there is any **redirection** it will need to redirect stdin (0), stdout(1), or stderr(2)
    * standard input  (the keyboard)
    * standard output (the terminal)
    * standard output (the terminal, but with system error messages)
  * Basic systax of a full command line
    * Command A | Command B | Command C > outfile < infile 2> errfile
      * **Important Notes!!**
        * Command A creates an output to B, and B to C ...
          * ```>``` will output the outfile
          * ```<``` will output from the infile into Command A
          * ```2>``` will output any standard error message to the errfile
            * The normal output for an stderr is stdout
            * stderr will only output to errfile in three cases that I know of:
              * The final pipeline command has and error
              * The entire pipeline inside is self contained
              * ```>&``` will output a simple command error to errfile
```
ls | grep "all" | non-command > output < infile 2> errfile
```
```
{ ls --invalid-option | grep "all" | wc -c; } > output < infile 2> errfile
```
4. Shell Subsystems
   * Environment Variables
    * ```$VAR``` is mostly the same as ```${VAR}```
      * ```${VAR}``` will keep variable from getting combined
      * EX: ```echo -n ${PATH}$'\n'```
    * A shell should be able to set, expand, and print environment variables
      * set:  ```export MY_VAR="Hello World"```
      * expand: ```echo $MY_VAR``` (notice there is no quotes)
      * print: ```echo "Hello, $MY_VAR"``` or ```echo '$MY_VAR'``` (notice there is quotes)
  * Wildcards
    * arguments contain a sequence of characters and a ```*``` and are expanded to all files that match inside the directory
    * ```echo *.txt``` would output the text of all file in the directory that end in '.txt'
  * Subshells
    * Arguments between ``` `` ``` are exectued and output to the shell
5. The Parser
 * The parser consists of two parts
   * Lexical Analyzer or Lexer [flex_wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_(lexical_analyser_generator)) | [flex_docs](https://westes.github.io/flex/manual/)
   * Token-sequence analyzer [bison_wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Bison) | [bison_docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#FAQ)
 * Useful Terms
     * Lexicon - all recognized words or tokens
     * Syntax - structure for creating valid statements

[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#What-is-Bash_003f)|
[C](https://sourceware.org/glibc/manual/latest/html_mono/libc.html#Library-Summary)|

1. The building blocks of the bash shell are:
* Commands
* Control structures
* Shell Functions
* Shell Parameters
* Shell Expansions
* Redirections
* Executing Commands
* Shell Scripts
2. Reading input
* Reading is a sequence of operations
  * **comments** are ignored ```#``` indicates a comment in bash
  * If not a comment, the input is parsed into **words** and **operators**, both known as **tokens**
    * When parsing, the quoting rules are applied
    * Tokens are separated by **metacharacters** or symbols with special meaning
    * Aliases are **expanded**
  *
