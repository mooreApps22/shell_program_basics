## **A shell program is a app that allows interacting with the Operating System
### **Parts of a Shell Program**

1. The Parser
* Interprets the command line and puts it into ```typedef struct s_cmd_tab```
* ```t_cmd_tab``` stores the commands that will be executed
2. The Executor
* Takes ```t_cmd_tab``` generated by the parser and creates a process for each command
  * if necessary it creates pipes ```|``` to read/write between each process
* If there is any **redirection** it will need to   
3. Shell Subsystems
